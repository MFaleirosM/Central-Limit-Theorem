This project aims to help understanding of the statistical characteristics of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) 
through sample simulations and visualizations, including histograms and density curves. Additionally, it features a 
Chi-Square simulation to illustrate the relationship between the CLT and other statistical concepts.

Understanding the Central Limit Theorem is important for undergraduate students, since it is a fundamental rock in 
the comprehesion of Hypothesis Test Methods. The CLT explains how the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as sample size increases, 
regardless of the original population distribution. This knowledge is essential for making inferences from data and applying 
statistical analysis.
